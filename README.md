### Spam Message Detection

**Overview:**
This project is dedicated to creating a machine learning model for the detection of spam messages. Given the rising tide of unsolicited and potentially harmful messages, it's imperative to establish an effective system to filter out such content. This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) methods and machine learning algorithms to categorize messages as either spam or non-spam.

**Dataset:**
The dataset utilized for training and evaluation comprises labeled SMS messages, with each message annotated as either spam or ham (non-spam).

**Approach:**

**Preprocessing:**
- **Tokenization:** Messages are tokenized into individual words to extract features.
- **Normalization:** Text is converted to lowercase for consistency.
- **Stopword Removal:** Common stopwords are eliminated to focus on meaningful words.
- **Feature Engineering:** Additional features like message length, presence of special characters, etc., are extracted to enhance model performance.

**Model Selection:**
Various machine learning algorithms are explored, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest

Models are assessed based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Model Evaluation:**
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure the models' robustness and generalization. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize model performance.

**Results:**
The best-performing model is chosen based on evaluation metrics. Performance metrics on the test set include:
- Accuracy: [insert accuracy]
- Precision: [insert precision]
- Recall: [insert recall]
- F1-score: [insert F1-score]

**Usage:**

**Data Preparation:**
Ensure the dataset is in the appropriate format (e.g., CSV) and contains labeled messages.

**Model Training:**
Execute the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks to train the model on the dataset.

**Model Evaluation:**
Evaluate the trained model using the provided evaluation scripts or notebooks.

**Deployment:**
Integrate the trained model into an application or service for real-time spam detection.

  ### Titanic Survival Prediction

**Overview:**
The Titanic Survival Prediction project utilizes logistic regression to forecast passenger survival aboard the Titanic. Employing machine learning techniques, this project delves into the factors influencing survival during the historic maritime disaster. By training a logistic regression model on the Titanic dataset, which contains passenger information like age, gender, ticket class, etc., the aim is to accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not. Additionally, a web page has been developed to offer an interactive platform for users to input passenger details and receive survival predictions instantly.

**Web Page Description:**
The web page crafted for the Titanic Survival Prediction project offers a user-friendly interface for predicting passenger survival. Users can input various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc., and the logistic regression model will assess whether the passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster. The web page ensures accessibility and ease of use, catering to anyone interested in exploring the data and predictions.

**Features of the Web Page:**

**Input Fields:**
- Pclass (Ticket class: 1, 2, or 3)
- Sex (Male or Female)
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket Fare
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

**Predict Button:**
- Clicking this button triggers the logistic regression model to make a prediction based on the user-provided input.

**Prediction Result:**
- The prediction result is displayed below the input fields, indicating whether the passenger would have survived or not.

**Project Overview:**
The Titanic Survival Prediction project endeavors to forecast passenger survivability using logistic regression. Training the logistic regression model on the Titanic dataset, which encompasses passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, etc., the model predicts the likelihood of survival for each passenger based on the available features. The web page interface offers a seamless platform for users to interact with the model, enabling them to input relevant information and receive immediate predictions. Beyond providing insights into the factors influencing survival on the Titanic, this project underscores the application of machine learning in historical data analysis.
